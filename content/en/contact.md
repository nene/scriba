## Scriba LLC

**Scriba Translation Agency offers opportunities that
enhance the effectiveness of the business of our clients and
facilitate the achievement of established aims together.**

The most frequent practice is that each **translator or interpreter**
only translates or interprets into his/her mother tongue. For in
addition to awareness and understanding of cultural nuances, each
person feels most comfortable in their mother tongue. While writing in
mother tongue brings out semantic connections, it cannot be said that
each person is able to produce a text devoid of grammatical or
spelling errors.

To introduce all services provided and explain the differences of
translations of various languages, we have created separate pages
which should give you an overview of the services and working methods
of Scriba.
