## Ask for a price offer!

Precise quotations can be given for documents the characters of which
allow to be copied (file extensions doc, txt, pdf, rtf, html etc.). In
case of documents that cannot be copied [copies, scanned documents,
drawings, screenshots], the price is calculated on the basis of the
characters of the translated text.
