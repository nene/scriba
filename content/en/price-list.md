## Price list

**Translation price is based on characters - 1 page equals 1,800
characters, including spaces.** If your company requires translation
services frequently, we recommend you to approach us and suggest a
regular client contract with us, which gives a discount from the
ordinary price of our services. You can always ask for the translation
options of other languages, and if possible, we shall seek a
translator/interpreter you may require or refer you to a person who
can help you. The approximate translation price can be calculated on
the price calculator page. In case of international transfers we use
Euro. The minimum fee is the price of one page.
